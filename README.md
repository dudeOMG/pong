# Pong

This is a very basic canvas implementation of Atari's popular game, first released in 1972.

Very lightweight, the implementation is around 200 lines of code.

## Features

- Vanilla JavaScript, no dependencies
- Multiplayer
- Scoring

Due to its lightness, there are some missing key features, e.g.:

- Sound
- AI
- Proper ball reflection with vectors and trigonometry

## How to play
